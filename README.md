# Marbella Spanish School

![screenshot-responsive-design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78651133/164167538-cd3bb96a-e882-4d80-b362-38d3a7b96a21.jpg)

The Marbella Spanish School is a website designed to advertise the fictional aforementioned academic private school and enroll students onto the courses it offers. The school offers a Full-time Course and Part-Time Course and carries out examinations based on the Common European Language Framework.

The website contains three main pages: About, Contact and Sign Up, which are all linked together to give guided content.

Users of the website are able to find all the information they need regarding the school and what it is offers, its location and time schedule and are able to sign-up for its services. The website is targeted towards students of any age looking to achieve official certification in the Spanish language.

The project is the first milestone of five that needs to be completed for the Code Institute. The requirement is to create a static, responsive website just using HTML and CSS3. 

The deployed version of the site can be found here: https://keironchaudhry.github.io/p1-marbella-spanish-school/

**Requirements**

To create a static website applying the knowledge of what has been learned so far that contains responsive functionality and smooth user design. The development of the site should be controlled and documented through Github. 

The required technologies are HTML and CSS3.

# UX 

### **User Demographic**

This site has been designed for students of all ages that wish to study Spanish and obtain certification. 

### **User Goals**

* To be able to find out information about the school.
* To be able to contact the school.
* To be able to find its location instantly.
* To be able to sign up.

### **Design**

The design has been inspired by the Love Running project. The code for the footer was borrowed from that project, although different Font Awesome icons have been used. The design of the header has been influenced by that same project.

The aim of the website has been to create a simple website with a pleasing colour scheme, which is appropriate to colours associated with the Spanish language and culture (especially around the Marbella area) and that also contains a high level of functionality.

The Marbella Spanish School is a website consisting of three HTML pages that are all interlinked and consistent in design. The navigation bar menu is fixed at the top and the footer is found at the bottom. At the bottom of every page there is always another link to the following page to encourage users to proceed.

There is also a fourth HTML page which is for the form-dump, that allows users to know that their submission has been successful.

### **Typography**

The fonts applied to this website was Bebas Neue as the principal font of the headers and subheadings, and Montserrat for the rest of the smaller font types. 

### **Colour scheme**

The colour design used for MSS was a blend between Orange, Orangered, White and Goldenrod. This colour design was influenced by my own geometric patterns that I personally practise at home. The colour design is relevant to the theme of the site, which is the Spanish language, as Oranges and Lemons and their associated trees are a well known aspect of Southern Spanish culture. It also holds relevance to the national flag, which is a scheme of Orange and Yellow. 

### **Images**

All images have been chosen in accordance with the design, content relevance and colour-scheme of the website. The purpose of the website is to give an air of Mediterranean culture and scholarship, yet simple enough within that content to attract students and maintain their interest.

# Testing

Testing the functionality and overall appearence of the website has been largely dealt with throughout the creation and development of the website.

Tests have been conducted using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Testing the different sizes has been carried out using Google Developer Tools.

The issues that came about were:

1. Deployment of website would not initially work and the deployed link went to a blank, basic READme.
* Solution: Folder and files in the First Project main branch were not orderly. Shifted style.css file out of a CSS folder, moved into the main First Project folder, renamed CSS folder to Assets and moved Images into it. Then renamed first-project.html to index.html.

2. Poor performance on smaller screens. Mostly trouble with navigation bar and the anchor links cropped with the logo as from 768px and below.
* Solution: Used media queries to align the anchor elements below the logo as from 768px downwards.

3. Data form allows users to submit their information, even when an email hasn't been provided.
* Solution: E-mail input type was incorrectly entered as text, has since been changed to email.

4. Poor performance from hero-image on the Contact page.
* Solution: Using media queries for different screen sizes and lower, have adjusted the CSS style so that it can be displayed correctly.

5. Navigation bar on Mozilla Firefox browser was not cropping correctly despite it functioning on Safari and Google Chrome.
* Solution: Removed float from the style.css file for screens 768px or lower.

6. Recommended links on About page begin to crop outside of the website border as screen-size lower.
* Solution: Lower font size and spacing between anchor links.

7. Footer crops outside of website border as screen sizes collapse lower.
* Solution: Changed the font size on the i elements to fix the spacing. 

**Ongoing bugs**

1. Poor performance and cropping of elements below 320px or lower.

**Validator testing**

* HTML

    * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Validator 

![html validator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78651133/164883156-5957cf05-79e2-417f-ae18-a6bcf9f82e84.jpg)

* CSS

    * No errors were returned when passing through the official Jigsaw validator

* Lighthouse testing
