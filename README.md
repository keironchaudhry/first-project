# Marbella Spanish School

The Marbella Spanish School is a website designed to advertise the fictional aforementioned academic private school and enroll students onto the courses it offers. The Marbella Spanish School offers a Full-time Course and Part-Time Course and carries out examinations based on the Common European Language Framework.

The website contains three main pages: About, Contact and Sign Up, which are all linked together to give guided content.

Users of the website are able to find all the information they need regarding the school and what it is offers, its location and time schedule and are able to sign-up for its services. The website is targeted towards students of any age looking to achieve official certification in the Spanish language.

The project is the first milestone of five that needs to be completed for the Code Institute. The requirement is to create a static, responsive website just using HTML and CSS3. 

The deployed version of the site can be found here: https://keironchaudhry.github.io/first-project/sign-up.html

# UX 

**User Demographic**

This site has been designed for students of all ages that wish to study Spanish and obtain certification. 

**User Goals**

* To be able to find out information about the school.
* To be able to contact the school.
* To be able to find its location instantly.
* To be able to sign up.

**Design**

This being my first project, the design has been by the Love Running project. The code for the footer was borrowed from that project, although different Font Awesome icons have been used. The design of the header has been influenced by that same project.

The aim of the website has been to create a simple website with a pleasing colour scheme, which is appropriate to colours associated with the Spanish language and culture (especially around the Marbella area) and that also contains a high level of functionality.

The Marbella Spanish School is a website consisting of three HTML pages that are all interlinked and consistent in design. The navigation bar menu is fixed at the top and the footer is found at the bottom. At the bottom of every page there is always another link to the following page to encourage users to proceed.

**Typography**

The fonts applied to this website were Montserrat as the principal font of the headers and subheadings, and 

**Colour scheme**

The colour design used for MSS was a blend between Orange, Orangered, White and Goldenrod. This colour design was influenced by my own geometric patterns that I personally practise at home. The colour design is relevant to the theme of the site, which is the Spanish language, as Oranges and Lemons and their associated trees are a well known aspect of Southern Spanish culture. It also holds relevance to the national flag, which is a scheme of Orange and Yellow. 

**Images**

All images have been chosen in accordance with the design, content relevance and colour-scheme of the website. The purpose of the website is to give an air of Mediterranean culture and scholarship, yet simple enough within that content to attract students and maintain their interest.
