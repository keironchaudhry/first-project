            <h2>About the Spanish language</h2>
                <br>
            <p>Welcome to the Marbella Spanish School, an institute ready to teach you 
                the beauty of the Spanish language, or 'Español', as it is widely known.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Spanish, Español (also known as ‘Castellano’, or Castilian), is a Romance language dating back to early Medieval Times, 
                which flourished in mainland Spain first as a dialect and eventually as a standard all around the Iberian peninsula. 
                Since Spanish is of Latin origin, it’ll be more familiar to students than we think.</p>
                <br>
            <p>In fact, learning Spanish isn’t all that hard at all! “Independiente, la clase, la persona, el musica, la lengua”. 
                Do you recognise these words? That’s because you already have an inherent vocabulary from English. Many words in Spanish and English are 
                related via a shared vocabulary due to an intertwined European history! In fact, you already know thousands of words in Spanish, you just don’t realise it yet!</p>
